    "# Week 8 - Making big(ger) data eas(ier) with data frames\n",
    "*© 2020 Colin Conrad*\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 8 of INFO 6270! Last week we explored social media data. This week we are going to explore one of the most powerful tools in the data scientists' toolbox: the *dataframe*. The pandas dataframe is a tool which makes it easier to navigate and analyze large datasets. Built upon numpy and other dependencies, this tool is among the most essential resources for conducting analysis on larger datasets. We will also use this tool in all subsequent lab, so be sure to explore this one closely!\n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Turn your dataset into a dataframe and start querying!\n",
    "- Collect descriptive statistics from your dataframe\n",
    "- Make changes to your dataframe\n",
    "- Identify opportunities to use numpy"

    "# Case: Airbnb\n",
    "It's pretty likely that you know something about [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca/). Airbnb has been called the [world's largest hotel chain](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/08/11/airbnb-surpasses-ihg-wyn-hilton-marriott-listings.html), while owning no hotels themselves. As a crowdsourcing platform, users can list their properties and rent them out to short-term renters using the Airbnb app. Though the company is not yet 12 years old as of 2020, it is among the world's most valuable privately owned companies with a market valuation of over [$35 billion](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/19/18272274/airbnb-valuation-common-stock-hoteltonight).\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is not without controversy. Airbnb has been identified by the [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-economic-costs-and-benefits-of-airbnb-no-reason-for-local-policymakers-to-let-airbnb-bypass-tax-or-regulatory-obligations/) as an important factor in rising rent an property prices, despite often escaping tax and regulation. The company [regularly releases their application data publicly](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Though we cannot investigate this phenomenon in one lab, this is a useful resource for learning about data science tools."

    "As discussed in class, numpy and pandas are two distinct tools which are like peas in a pod. Numpy is a tool for transforming your data into a multi-dimensional array, sort of like a hyper-efficient Python list. The pandas (PANel + DAta) library transforms our data into numerical tables (a.k.a. data frames) which are easier to calculate and sort through. We will start with Pandas because this is the tool that will be most useful for most of you.\n",

    "Perhaps the coolest feature of a dataframe is that it facilitates efficient queries and to retrieve subsets of the data. In pandas, a subset is declared by writing square brackets following the data frame-- for instance, `nyc['neighbourhood_group']` would return the values of neighborhood. However, we can also use this to conduct Boolean searches as well. For instance, if we wanted to retrieve only the values where `neighbourhood_group == Brooklyn` we could write a query as follows."
