"[1] Excludes census data for one or more incompletely enumerated Indian reserves or Indian settlements."
"[2] Primary household maintainer - The first person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent, or the mortgage, or the taxes, or the electricity or other services or utilities for the dwelling. When more than one member of the household contributes to the payments, the first person listed is chosen as the primary household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments, the first person listed is selected by default.   The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which they are listed on the questionnaire. Generally, an adult is listed first followed, if applicable, by their spouse or common-law partner and then by their children. The order does not necessarily correspond to the proportion of household payments made by each person."
"[2] For more information, refer to the Census Dictionary: Household type; Census family structure."
"[3] Tenure - Refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling. The private dwelling may be situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium. A household is considered to own their dwelling if some member of the household owns the dwelling even if it is not fully paid for, for example if there is a mortgage or some other claim on it. A household is considered to rent their dwelling if no member of the household owns the dwelling. A household is considered to rent that dwelling even if the dwelling is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent, or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative.       Presence of mortgage payments- Refers to whether an owner household makes regular mortgage or loan payments for their dwelling.      Subsidized housing - Refers to whether a renter household lives in a dwelling that is subsidized.     Subsidized housing includes rent geared to income, social housing, public housing, government-assisted housing, non-profit housing, rent supplements and housing allowances."
"[4] Adequacy, suitability and affordability are the three housing indicators presented here. The indicator for housing adequacy is the dwelling condition. The indicator for housing suitability (a topic often referred to as crowding) is whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. The indicator of housing affordability is the proportion of household total income that is spent on shelter costs, also referred to as shelter-cost-to-income ratio.  'Dwelling condition' refers to whether the dwelling is in need of repairs. This does not include desirable remodelling or additions.  The category 'major repairs needed' includes dwellings needing major repairs such as dwellings with defective plumbing or electrical wiring and dwellings needing structural repairs to walls, floors or ceilings.  'Housing suitability' refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated using the NOS.  Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.  The category 'not suitable' includes households where the required number of bedrooms based on the NOS exceeds the reported number of bedrooms in the dwelling.  'Shelter-cost-to-income ratio' refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs.  The category '30% or more of household income is spent on shelter costs' includes households who spend 30% or more of their average monthly total income on shelter costs.  For more information, refer to the Census Dictionary: Dwelling condition; Housing suitability; Shelter-cost-to-income ratio."
"[5] This category includes households who fall below at least one of the adequacy, suitability or affordability housing indicators."
